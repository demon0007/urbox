This is a Project we made in our B.E. - 3rd Year as a Course Mini Project. The objective of the project was to make a full fledged website that uses DBMS concepts.

This project is a simpler form of big applications like Dropbox and Google Drive, It allows the user to login see already present files and upload new ones. For the sake of demonstration the size limit was set on the files that can be uploaded.

The project uses:
	* HTML CSS Bootstrap Fontawesome JS for front-end development
	* And a large amount of PHP for backend handling of requests
	* The database used is MySQL

We tested this project in WAMP server.

Configuration

If You wish to run the project import the urbox.sql file (which is in /db directory) into your MySQL server under the database name urbox and change the credentials accordingly in connect.php.
